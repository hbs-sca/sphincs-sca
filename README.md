# DPA on a BLAKE-256-based PRF within SPHINCS-256

We propose and implement a DPA on a BLAKE-256-based PRF. We evaluated our attack using physically measured power consumption traces of an ARM Cortex-M3 executing the code in [blake256.c](blake256.c)

We are currently referring to this code in a paper in submission to a venue that requires anonymous submissions. This is why we also keep this anonymous.
